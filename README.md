This project is currently in the development phase, with ongoing improvements and enhancements. Our aim is to provide a robust classification system for kidney stones.

Please note that while the project is still under development, there's plenty of room for improvement and innovation. We're dedicated to refining the classification process to enhance accuracy and efficiency in identifying kidney stones.

We're proud to announce that our current model has achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 99%, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach. However, we remain committed to further optimizing and fine-tuning the system for even greater precision.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to evolve and enhance the capabilities of our kidney stone classification system. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we work towards creating a more effective solution in this important healthcare domain.
